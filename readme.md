This project was done for personal use to record how much I have earned in tips in my current part-time job.
Feel free to use this program for whatever needs you might have. Make sure to create a local.env file 
to assign your variables for the mysql.connector to connect to your local MySQL database. Lastly, make sure
to create your database and data table before attempting to connect or it will not work.

Things to still do:
    - Implement radio buttons to delete multiple entries
    - Aesthetics such as focus set buttons when clicked
